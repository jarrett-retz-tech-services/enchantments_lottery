    "However, they didn't have to choose three options. Some applicants only chose to submit one option. Just looking at the `Preferred Entry Date 1`, applicants applied for trips between May 15 and October 30. Applicants chose group sizes between 1-8.\n",
    "\n",
    "A total of 36,695 applications made up the lottery in 2021 (the website PDF says 39,695 but the data spreadsheet only has 36,695 rows, I believe the website PDF is a typo).\n",

    "\n",
    "> A group may consist of up to eight people, must camp in the Zone indicated on their permit for up to 14 days. The number of overnight groups/people that may enter each day is split by zone during permit season:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   \\*Core Enchantments Zone : 24 people per day (cannot increase group size after lottery)\n",
    "-   Colchuck Lake Zone: three groups per day\n",
    "-   Stuart Lake Zone: four groups per day\n",
    "-   Snow Lakes Zone: five groups per day\n",

    "\n",
    "### Awarded Permits\n",
    "\n",
    "Just because a permit is awarded, doesn't mean that the applicant went on the trip. Looking at the `Results Status` there are possible values of:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Unsuccessful\n",
    "-   Accepted\n",
    "-   Cancelled\n",
    "-   No Response\n",
    "-   Declined\n",
    "\n",
    "**In 2021, 352 applications didn't response to their awarded lottery, which they had won!** This statistic is even more shocking because I applied for a lottery in 2021 and was `Unsuccessful`. I found my application in row `931` (932 if not using a zero-index). Oddly, there were only 53 other applicants that applied for the same entry date and zone that I did. I'll have to double that after cleaning the data, but that'd be a surprisingly low number for a Friday in late August for the Colchuck Zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equally interesting is that if hundreds go unnclaimed and, as stated on the website, _All unclaimed lottery awards will be returned to the advance reservation system April 1 around 7a.m. PT._ There should be a decent size chunk of permits available for reservation to the fastest and luckiest _clickers_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, I found a very slight difference in \"Awarded\" permits as the website PDF displayed the statistics. The PDF (linked above) said 2,444 permits were awarded in 2021. Looking at the data in `Results Status`:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Unsuccessful 33800\n",
    "-   Accepted 2036\n",
    "-   Cancelled 450\n",
    "-   No Response 352\n",
    "-   Declined 57\n",
    "\n",
    "If you add `Accepted` + `No Response` + `Declined` you get 2,445, which is one more than the stated number of 2,444. I'll have to double check the numbers after cleaning, but this is an oddity if not another mistake.\n",

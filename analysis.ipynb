    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### General\n",
    "\n",
    "-   July sees the second most application options entries by month (~40k for August, ~30k for July, ~23k for September).\n",
    "-   May, October, and June had by far the best awarded-to-skipped ratios. There's not a huge difference between July and August/September. I don't think you gain that much by applying for September or July over August.\n",
    "-   Sunday sees by far the least amount of competition.\n",
    "-   Mondays are very competitive! Avoid Thursdays, Fridays, and Mondays.\n",
    "-   Saturdays are less competitive than Mondays.\n",
    "-   Colchuck isn't that much less competitive than Core.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Zone\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Applicants should submit _at least one_ option for the Core Enchantments out of their three options.\n",
    "-   Friday, Tuesday, and Sunday had the best awarded-to-skipped ratios for the Core Enchantments\n",
    "-   Group sizes of 1, 3, and 2 had the best awarded-to-skipped ratios for the Core Enchantments\n",
    "-   Avoid high odd numbers for group sizes in the Core Enchantments. A group size of 8 is better than 5 and 7. These group sizes have the worse awarded-to-skipped ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   There's a bit of game theory going on with the lottery. Applicants should consider what other people do in terms of group size (odd vs. even) and day of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I'd Do\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If I had to apply today based on these results, this is what I'd do:\n",
    "    -   Option 1: Core Enchantments Zone, Group Size of 3, Sunday, August\n",
    "    -   Option 2: Colchuck Zone, Group Size of 3, Sunday, late July\n",
    "    -   Option 3: Stuart Zone, Group Size of 3, Sunday, August\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me explain each of these choices and my reasoning behind them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Enchantments Zone, Group Size of 3, Sunday, August\n",
    "\n",
    "A total of 1,039 applicants were awarded permits other than the Core Zone **despite** applying for at least one Core Zone option (~42.5% of the permits awarded). If you add the people that applied for the Core Zone and won that number jumps to 1,712 (70%). Therefore, you don't lose much by applying for the Core Zone in one entry. You still have a good chance of winning a permit. What matters is that you hedge your chances of winning in later options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing that I should apply for the Core Zone, I'd reduce my chances of being skipped in two ways. First, I'd select a group size of 3. A group size of three had the second best awarded-to-skipped ratio which was ahead of a group size of 2. Group sizes of 4 had a worse ratio than group sizes of 6. A group size of 1 would be the best option, but I'd rather not go alone. Second, I'd choose a Sunday. Starting your trip on a Sunday had, by far, the best ratio of awarded-to-skipped. Trips starting on Friday or Monday were about twice as likely to be skipped rather than awarded compared to Sundays.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the month, the best months for avoiding being skipped are May, October, and June. Unfortunately, these months are all questionable weather months. They're not worth the effort or risk to me. Conversely, July, August, and September are better months for weather. So why would I choose August instead of July or September? Well, the month with the worse awarded-to-skipped ratio was September and the difference between the awarded-to-skipped ratio for July to August was pretty small. The benefits of August seem to greatly outweight the small gain of choosing July over August.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of group size is only relevant for the Core Zone. The entry date of Sunday is repeated in all three options so I won't repeat my reasoning in later explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Colchuck Zone, Group Size of 4, Sunday, late July\n",
    "\n",
    "The Snow Zone provided the second most permits in the lottery behind the Core Enchantment Zone. Additionally, applicants were more than twice as likely to receive a permit for the Snow Zone (7.46%) compared to the Colchuck Zone (2.97%). So why would I still choose the Colchuck Zone over the Snow Zone given these probabilities?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two reasons why applying for the Snow Zone is less desirable than the Colchuck Zone:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The hike into the Snow Zone is longer than the Colchuck Zone and the climb from the Snow Zone into the Lower Enchantments is worse, in my opinion, than the climb from Aasgard Pass (above Colchuck) to the Upper Enchantments. From the Snow Lakes trailhead into the Core Enchantments is some 8 or 9 miles if I remember. And the rock faces, big step up, and unneasy terrain between Snow Lakes and the Lower Enchantments is brutal and, _in my opinion_, more dangerous than Aasgard Pass. There's a reason much more people are going up Aasgard than Snow Lakes. It's enough for me to ignore the probability data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Colchuck Lake is beautiful. Even if you don't decide to go up Aasgard Pass into the Upper Enchantments a trip to Colchuck Lake is stunning. Even with the crowds, crazy parking lots, etc. The scenery at Colchuck Lake is far and away more worth it than Snow Lake. The Snow Lakes are a loved part of the Enchantment Permit Zone, but they are not why people go to the Enchantment Permit Zone. I'll take my chances.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd be slightly increasing my chances of being awarded a permit compared to the Core Enchantment Zone in the Colchuck Zone in Option 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for choosing late July, instead of August, is a break from my Option 1 explanation. What gives? Colchuck is a few thousand feet lower than the Core Enchantment Zone. The climb up would be easier and the conditions would _probably_ be better. I would take the small increase in awarded-to-skipped ratio in this situation because I'd be camping at a lower and easier to reach elevation. Camping at Colchuck Lake would still provide the opportunity to hike up to the Enchantments during the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Day selection are the same as Option 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stuart Zone, Group Size 4, Sunday, August\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous two options saw the zones and months change in an attempt to better my chances as my options get deeper. Option 3 is no exception. I again want to increase my chances by choosing a less competitive zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The zones of the Enchantments are hard to understand. Making things worse are \"complete\" guides online that don't talk about how different each zone is. For example, the Eightmile/Caroline Zone is no where near the beautiful lakelets and sharp peaks of the Core Enchantments or Colchuck Zone. The Jack Creek Fire burned the landscape around Eightmile Lake making it, as the numbers show, less desirable. The Forest Service has also had to reduce permits in the area due to the fire.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the uninitiated, the Snow Zone and Colchuck may seem on level playing ground for having a chance to get up into the Core Enchantments but they are quite different in difficulty and beauty. There are reasons why the Colchuck Zone is almost as competitive as the Core Zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, the Stuart Zone is miles away from the Colchuck Zone and much different than all the other zones. Despite the Stuart Zone not having the most lakes, or jagged peaks, it's a very underrated zone. As mentioned in an online trip report, the lake is not dammed, giving it a very natural shoreline. It also, due to it's unpopularity, provides more solitude than the other zones while still providing pretty spectacular views of the surrounding mountains (including Mount Stuart).\n",
    "\n",
    "The trail to Stuart Lake is certainly not as steep, rocky, or long as the trail to the other more popular zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Camping at Stuart Lake provides opportunities for a grueling obstacle course hike up to the magnificent Horseshoe Lake, or a worthy day hike to Colchuck Lake. It's not _THE_ Enchantments, but it's a great plan B.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasoning behind day of the week, and Month are the same as Option 1.\n"
